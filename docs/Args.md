# Steps Arguments

Args are single quoted tokens in a [Step](https://github.com/limadelic/contextual/blob/master/docs/Steps.md)  
They are represented as **@x** in the declaration   
And their values are passed in left to right order as a function parameter  

**Example** [ [Login](https://github.com/limadelic/contextual/blob/master/docs/src/login.coffee) ]
```
when Jim logs in  
it should say Hello lizard king  
```

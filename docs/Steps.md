# Simple Steps

Every line is a potential step  
To become a step it needs to be declared in a class as a function  
The [Login](https://github.com/limadelic/contextual/blob/master/docs/src/login.coffee) class implements the following steps

### Example
```
When an user logs in  
it should be greeted  
```
# Pending Steps

Pending steps are declared as fields instead of a functions  
A document with pending steps will render yellow in the console output  
The field's value will be included in the output  
The [Misc](https://github.com/limadelic/contextual/blob/master/docs/src/misc.coffee) class contains a pending step  

### Example
```
this is a pending step  
```

# Simple Steps

Every line is a potential step  
To become a step it needs to be declared in a class as a function  
Check out the [Login](https://github.com/limadelic/contextual/blob/master/docs/src/login.coffee) class that implements the following steps  

### Example
```
When an user logs in  
it should be greeted  
```
# Pending Steps

A pending step is declared as a field instead of a function  
The document with pending steps will render yellow in the text output  
The field's value will be included in the output
Check out the [Misc](https://github.com/limadelic/contextual/blob/master/docs/src/misc.coffee) class containing a pending step  

### Example
```
this is a pending step  
```
